# FLIT-Cloud-Project 2023 
## Introduction
The project comprises pre-project tasks and also the task itself. The pre-project task contains a valuable toolkit that an apprentice may have acquired in the past. These competencies will prove advantageous as they transition into a more hands-on role as an apprentice. Consequently, revisiting these skills is of paramount importance. Each activity will be meticulously documented in a GitHub repository.

## Main Project
